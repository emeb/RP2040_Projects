This is an attempt to make a programmable version of the Buddha Box PCB that fits
into the same shape as the original. Includes the same thumbwheel pot + switch
control but swaps in a micro USB for the headphone jack. 

Looks like the proposed circuit is too large to fit into the original area.
Additionally, the original PCB is a 35mil thickness vs 63mil for standard
OSHpark PCBs.
